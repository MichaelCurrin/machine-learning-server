# This is the file to configure how predictions are done on the
# Color Classifier and also includes metadata to describe how
# current version of the model was trained.

# In strings, escape '%' with '%%' in order to avoid subsitution errors.

### Model training ###

# The metadata describe are only for understanding how a model was trained
# and configuring them here will not have any effect.
